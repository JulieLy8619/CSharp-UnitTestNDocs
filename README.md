## Solution
For a user they are introduced with a menu with options to view their balance, make a deposit or make a withdrawl.
Say the user would like to view their balance they would enter 1, 2 for deposit, 3 for a withdrawl, and finally 4 if they would like to exit.
A user may go through this menu as many times until they choose to exit.
No additional information for program use at this time.
